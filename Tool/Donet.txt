Net Framework, HttpWebReqeust and WebClient exist default max connection limitation, 
personal windows OS is 2 and window server OS is 10, because Http 1.0/1.1 have this rule of maxconnection for concurrency connection;
but current broswer not follow this rule.
Two way change
1. application set
System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit = 512;
2. app.config set
<configuration>
<system.net>
<connectionManagement>
<add address = "http://www.google.com" maxconnection = "512" />
<add address = "*" maxconnection = "512" />
</connectionManagement>
</system.net>
</configuration>
